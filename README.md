# Cross-Validation for Regression in Artificial Neural Networks (Python)

## Description
This code shows how to use cross-validation for a regression problem in which somebody is looking forward to use artificial neural networks. It's actually a random dataset that has been generated. The ANN is a model that has been developed previously. The structures is as follows:
1) libraries installation, imports, etc.
2) Definition of the random dataset
3) Train/Test split
4) ANN definition
5) KFold and estimator definition. The estimator has been made with SciKeras library
6) Prediction/ fitting

## How to install this
1) Download the code
2) Make sure that you installed:
    * Tensorflow. The code was developed with Python 3.11
    * Scikeras (documentation: https://adriangb.com/scikeras/stable/)
    * SK-Learn

## How to tweak this code
There are several point to tweek. At least for me, the most important are the following ones:
    * K divisions
    * Model ANN

## Found a bug?
Please let us know by writing it down and your thoughts about what caused that bug. Try to explain as much as you can. It will be very appreciate it

## Work in progress
Other cross-validation techniques will be tests too.
